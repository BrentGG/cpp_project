# CPP Project

This repository contains two projects. [Game](https://github.com/BrentGG/cpp_project/tree/main/game) is the beginnings of a top-down shooter. [Calculator](https://github.com/BrentGG/cpp_project/tree/main/calculator) is a very simple CLI calculator. Below are guides on how to run and use both programs.

## Game

1. Install [QtCreator](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source)
2. When installing QtCreator you can of course choose which version of Qt and which compiler you use. However, I used Qt 6.4.0 and MinGW 64-bit, so if you use anything else I cannot guarantee that the programs will run as intended.
3. In QtCreator, choose "File" > "Open File or Project" and navigate to and select the ``game.pro`` file.
4. Wait for the project to open and click the run button or press ``ctrl+R``.
5. Once the program has started, use ZQSD to move your character, the enemies will follow you around.

4. Wait for the project to open and click the run button or press ``ctrl+R``.
5. Once the program has started the CLI will further guide you on how to use to program.
6. Logs are stored in the log.txt file.
